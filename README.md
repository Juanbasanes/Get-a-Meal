### Description of Project

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), approximately 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted globally each year. In the United States alone, around 30-40% of the food supply, equivalent to approximately 133 billion pounds, is wasted annually. The cost of global food waste is estimated to be $1 trillion per year.

The United Nations estimates that hunger and malnutrition are responsible for the deaths of around 3.1 million children under the age of five every year. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated food insecurity, pushing an additional 131 million people into hunger worldwide. In the United States, more than 42 million people, including 13 million children, were food insecure in 2020.

Food waste generates significant greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. It is estimated that if food waste were a country, it would be the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases after the United States and China (FAO). The water footprint of wasted food is approximately 250 kmÂ³, equivalent to the annual flow of Russia's Volga River (FAO). Land use associated with producing wasted food accounts for an area larger than China (FAO).

**"Share A Meal"** is a cutting-edge mobile application designed to connect food donors with local food banks shelters and pantries in need of donations. The app allows food donors to quickly and easily identify nearby organizations that accept donations and coordinate pickups or drop-offs by themselves. Users can create an account and manage their food donations through the app.

The app serves as a platform to bridge the gap between surplus food and hungry individuals, promoting a sustainable and efficient means of food distribution.

The app is designed for use by food donors of all types including individuals restaurants and grocery stores. It aims to streamline the donation process and make it more convenient for donors to support their local food banks and shelters. Through this app, food insecurity can decrease by increasing crucial donations to those in need.

With its user-friendly interface, "Share a Meal" allows donors to easily upload information about the surplus food they wish to donate. Users can provide details such as the type of food, quantity, and expiration date, ensuring transparency and accountability in the process. The app also enables donors to schedule pick-up times and locations, optimizing logistics and minimizing food waste.

On the recipient side, individuals or organizations seeking food assistance can search for available donations based on their location or specific dietary requirements. They can view relevant information about each donation, including the distance, food type, and estimated time for pick-up. By streamlining the process, "Share a Meal" ensures that donated food reaches those who need it most, reducing hunger and food insecurity in the community.

The app incorporates social features, allowing users to rate and provide feedback on their donation experiences. This feedback loop encourages accountability and fosters a sense of community engagement. Additionally, "Share a Meal" provides valuable resources and information on food safety, nutrition, and sustainable practices, promoting awareness and education surrounding food donations.

### Tech Stack

React Native is a popular cross-platform open-source mobile development framework for building native-like mobile applications for iOS and Android using a single codebase.

React Native provides a comprehensive tech stack for building mobile applications that are performantly scalable and easy to maintain.

* **Appwrite**

Appwrite is an open-source backend server, that played a crucial role in building this project. It provided easy integration for user authentication, database management, and file storage, enabling us to focus on the core features of the "Share a Meal" app. With Appwrite, we could efficiently manage user accounts, securely store and retrieve data related to donations and recipients, and handle file uploads for profile pictures and food images.

### Benefits

Share A Meal application have numerous benefits for everyone involved:

* **Reducing Food Waste**
   

The primary benefit of the application is that they reduce food waste. Instead of throwing away unsold food or items that are near their expiration date food businesses can donate them to people in need. This not only saves food from going to waste but also reduces the environmental impact of food waste.

* **Improving Food Access**
   

Increase in access to food for those who need it the most. Charities food banks and shelters can receive donations of fresh healthy food that they might otherwise not have been able to afford. This in turn helps to alleviate food insecurity and ensure that everyone has access to nutritious meals.

* **Saving Money**
   

Donating food through an app is often cheaper than throwing it away. When businesses throw away food they not only waste the ingredients but also have to pay for the cost of disposal. By donating excess food businesses can save money and put it to better use elsewhere.

Redirecting just one-third of the food wasted globally could feed over 800 million people (FAO). Efficient food redistribution efforts have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1.5 gigatons of CO2 equivalent annually, contributing to climate change mitigation. By preventing food waste, we can conserve natural resources such as water and land, and reduce the need for deforestation and intensive agriculture.

### Challenges We Faced

* **Authentication and Authorization:**

One of the primary concerns while developing an application is the authentication of users. This is important as you do not want unauthorized users to be able to access or modify the donated food data. Authorization also plays a crucial role in determining which users can donate or request food and what kind of information they can access. This can be a complex process that requires proper implementation of security measures to ensure that the data is safe from any unauthorized access. To achieve this we used **Appwrite web SDK** for Authentication and Authorization.

* **Database Management:**

Storing the large amount of data related to the donated food and registered users can be a daunting task especially if the app is used by a large group of users. You must ensure that the database is designed and optimized to handle a large number of records. To overcome the complexities we used **Appwrite web SDK** for database and image storage.

* **UI/UX Design:**

The user interface and user experience of the app play a crucial role in determining its success. Designing a user-friendly visually appealing and intuitive interface requires a lot of research planning and testing. The UI should be easy to use and navigate ensuring that users are able to complete the necessary tasks without any confusion.

* **Testing:**
   

Testing the app thoroughly is extremely important to ensure that the app is free of any bugs and issues. This includes functional testing performance testing and security testing. Testing can be time-consuming but is essential to ensure that the app works seamlessly.

In conclusion, creating an application can be challenging but with the right planning implementation and testing it can be a great success. Proper implementation of security measures designing a user-friendly interface and robust database management are some of the key factors that need to be taken care of while creating an application.
